# Deniz Ertunç

Software Developer focused on building modern full-stack web applications with TypeScript and the Next.js App Router.

I like server-first React, strong DX, clean UI systems, and products that feel polished (performance, SEO, and thoughtful interaction design).

---

## What I do

- Build full-stack TypeScript apps with Next.js (App Router) and modern React patterns (Server Components, Server Actions, ISR)
- Design UI systems with Tailwind CSS (including token-based design systems) and motion-driven interfaces (Framer Motion)
- Build data-driven features with PostgreSQL + Prisma, and production-grade auth flows (Clerk)
- Integrate headless CMS workflows (Sanity + GROQ) and rich content pipelines (Portable Text / MDX)
- Ship deployable projects with Docker, Railway, and Vercel

## What I’m focusing on now

- Building polished Next.js App Router projects that demonstrate modern architecture and best practices
- Strong design systems + motion as a product feature (not just decoration)
- Better automation and developer workflow improvements (tooling, scripts, repeatability)
